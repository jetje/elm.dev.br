# Programming for beginners

## Introduction

This site is created to teach programming.
You don't need any prior experience.
We are going to work with the main concepts
in a gradual and playful way.
In this course you will learn to draw figures
on the screen, create animations, working towards
simple games you can play in your browser! ðŸ•¹

But first, you need to understand some fundamentals.
So, would you like to accept this challenge??

## What is a computer program?

A **computer program** is nothing more than a text that
adheres to specific rules. The computer reads and
processes the text as a list of instructions and executes them.

A person who writes these kinds of texts
is called a "software developer" or computer programmer.
And the kind of texts this person writes,
that is read into the computer, was given a
special name: computer code, also called **code**
or **source code**.
In this course, we refer to this kind of text
as **code**.

The set of rules for how a computer program should
be written is defined by a **Programming Language**.
During the evolution of computation various
programming languages were created.
In this course we will use a language called
*<a href='https://elm-lang.org/' target='_blank'>Elm</a>*.

At the start of each lesson we are going to introduce
a new concept followed by some challenges.
It is **quite** important you engage with those challenges!
It is the most important (but also fun) part of the lessons.
Some challenges are easy, others more difficult.
It is normal to struggle a bit with them; it is part
of the learning process.
Explore, experiment and don't fear to make errors.
The worst that can happen is that you get an error
message. ðŸ˜†

## But how do we write a program in the first place?

Below we have our first example, the famous _"Hello World!"_,
outputting a simple text on screen.

```haskell
import Html exposing (text)

main =
  text "Hello World!"
```

And how can this program actually be **executed**?
In this course, you will do this in the browser! ðŸ˜„
Open a new tab and navigate to the following *site*:
<a href=https://elm-lang.org/try target='_blank'>https://elm-lang.org/try</a>.
Save this address as you will use it throughout the course.
Next, copy the entire example code above and paste it in the left part of the *site*.

Click *Rebuild* in the bottom center of the screen and you will see the result of
the execution of your code in the right part of the screen, like in the image below:

Congratulations! You have successfully created your first program written in the
programming language *Elm*! ðŸŽ‰

## And now?

In the next lessons you will learn how make drawings on screen
along with fundamental concepts of programming.
You will learn about functions, parameters and much more!

Now continue with [Lesson 2](/lesson_2.html) - happy studying!
